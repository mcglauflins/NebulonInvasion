# Theme Interpretation: "Everything is Alive"
In "Nebulon Invasion", I interpreted the theme "Everything is Alive" through a scientist's journey trying to get off a planet with important samples. What begins as the end of a routine data collection mission on a lifeless environment takes an unexpected turn when our player gets zapped off the bridge and descends into an underground tunnel system, only to find that they are not alone, and this planet does have life! The "mysteriously reactivated" portal suggests autonomous systems with purpose rather than random occurrences. The player's journey becomes not just about survival and extraction, but a realization that they're inside a living system that perceives them as the "alien intruder"

# How to Play
- Controls:
  A/D: Move left/right 
  W/S: Control movement when jumping
  SPACE: Jump
  Left click mouse: Attack

# Objectives:
  -Navigate through the underground caverns to alternate portal
  -Survive encounters with hostile creatures

# Game Elements:
  -Health System: Monitor your health bar at the top of the screen
  -Checkpoints: Activated by passing through beacon points
  -Guidance System: Watch for helpful tips that appear at screen bottom
  -Health Pickups: Collect these to restore health

# Development Notes
The game utilizes a custom guidance system that provides contextual information to the player through triggers placed at strategic points. A checkpoint system ensures progress is saved, while the health management system creates tension during encounters with the underground creatures. The contrast between the presumed lifeless world and the reality discovered underground reinforces our theme that life exists even where we least expect it. When project was built, the entire system got corrupted and I spent a lot of time today trying to fix it. I do not have a build but will try and restore. If you see anything wrong please help!
